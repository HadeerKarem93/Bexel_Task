Hello 
I work on pom model and my project structure is : inside "src" folder there are 2 folders, the first one "main" folder include the classes which have elements and functions , The second file "Test" include the classes which i excute test cases in it, You can run test cases from "testng xml file" or run every class in "test folder" sepratly except "testbase" class because it have only the configurations for before and after test.
